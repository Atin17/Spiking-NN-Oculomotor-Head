Pass left-right movement to both eyes, to make sure both eyes move in same direction - most of the time except for vergence
Neck movement neural network logic for movement


Goal: Manage pan/tilt positions
	- Restrict eye pan / tilt to a range of angles around 512 and nothing more.
	- If the pointer moves out of range, the neck needs to move.

Goal: Bring down the time to under 30ms for 2D movement
	- inverse map of pixel to neuron
	- find the max value and the field around it, process inputs for only these neurons
	- parallelize 
		- up/down and left/right neuron processing - 2 different threads
			- wait for both to complete
			- send command to the motor

Goal: Smooth movement of motors
	- 

Goal: Pursuit movement and saccade movement in 2D
	2 receptive fields - (saccades and pursuit movement)

	fovea =
		- logarithmic growth from center to the fovea end
	periphery =
		- logarithmic growth from fovea end to periphery end

Goal: PDI controller with Amacrine cells to control speed of movement
	- Memory (I - Integrator / Memory)
	- Differentiator (D - Speed)

Goal: Neck movement
	- Move only after eye has moved a fair bit
	- VOR
	- 

Goal: Live Feed with mask on top showing exactly where the laser pointer is within the receptive field
